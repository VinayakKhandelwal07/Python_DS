# Creating a variable
x = 12
y = "VInayak"

print(x)
print(y)

# Casting (If you want to specify the data type of a variable)
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0

# Get the Type 
x = 12
y = "VInayak"

print(type(x)) # x wll be int type
print(type(y)) # y will be string type

# VARIABLE NAME 

#A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# A variable name cannot start with a number
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
# A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.
